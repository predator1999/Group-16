# Group_16 - CommunityRetreat

Nowadays, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays a major role in most of the modern sustainable companies. It is basically about making choices that help the environment and social community. To achieve this motive, organizations throw huge community service projects. But do they ever get enough recognition from general public? Do they ever get a chance to give the exposure to their events?

It is true that there are enough social media platforms in the cyber world where anyone can market anything as they wish. But, voluntary events like community service projects needs a special platform where users of it will add a value to those projects.

In an organizational perspective, giving more exposure to their CSR aspects doesn’t just make the better organizational profile. It also creates a proper business environment which ultimately help to build up the better community. Through that it has the potential to boost the company revenues by increased customer satisfaction by facilitating their requirements.

On the other hand, people who like to donate or volunteer in these types of events have to specifically look into the projects that they would like to contribute or participate and it will take time. It’s not like they get to know much of opportunities available in the current society and therefore it could lead to a lack of the interest if they don’t find the perfect match or if they waste their time in the searching process. Giving them a separate platform, which is fully based on community wellbeing events would be highly effective and appreciated by such people.

As a team of four 2nd year undergraduates from University of Colombo School of Computing, Visal Jayathialke, Manuka Dewanarayana, Venodi Widanagamage & Semini Bodhinayaka came up together with the project idea of “CommunityRetreat”. In a nutshell, this is a software development project to help and uplift the community through providing a fully functional platform for community service projects. This project aims to provide more volunteering opportunities and to promote CSR events among the community.
